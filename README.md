Abstract—Carrier sense multiple access protocols in network-
ing will help to detect and avoid collision and will wait for
some back-off time if some collisions chances are there,which is
calculated using a binary exponential back-off algorithm (BEB).
Some random values will be selected from a range of 0 to
2n − 1 where n is the collision number. The algorithm helps in
reducing collision but still has vulnerabilities like capture effect
and increased overhead. In this paper, we are proposing a sliced
binary exponential back-off algorithm that will reduce collision
probability and capture the effect better than the traditional one.
Representing results as tables using various examples of datasets
and showcase the improvement through graphs.
